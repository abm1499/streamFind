\arguments{
\item{object}{A \linkS4class{data.table} as produced by
the method \code{\link{EICs}}.}

\item{analyses}{A numeric or character vector with the index or
analysis name/s. When \code{NULL}, all the analyses are used.}

\item{colorBy}{A length one character vector applicable to the
respective method.}

\item{legendNames}{A character vector with the same length and order
as the number and order of targets to be used as plot legend.}

\item{title}{A character string with the plot tile.}

\item{interactive}{Logical value, set to \code{TRUE} to use
the \pkg{plotly} instead of \pkg{base}. The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\description{
An S4 method for plotting extracted ion chromatograms (EICs)
of data in a \linkS4class{data.table} object obtained with the
\code{\link{EICs}} method. The \code{colorBy} argument can be be "analyses",
"replicates" or "targets" (the default), for coloring by analyses,
replicates or EICs targets (id), respectively. The \code{legendNames} is a
character vector with the same length as targets for plotting and can be
used to legend the plot. Note that, by setting \code{legendNames}
the \code{colorBy} is set to "targets" even when other is given.
