# Introduction to streamFind

The goal of the streamFind is to boost competences of researchers for data analysis. The focus is the development and assembly of data processing workflows for mass spectrometry (MS) and spectroscopy and the application of the workflows in environmental and quality studies of the water cycle. For the moment, the streamFind can be used via the [streamFind R package](https://github.com/ricardobachertdacunha?tab=repositories) back-end framework. For more information and usage of the R package see article ["*streamFind* framework for mass spectrometry with R"](https://ricardobachertdacunha.github.io/streamFind/articles/ms_overview.html).

# Future developments

Besides further development of the R package, a graphical user interface is planned to facilitate data analysis and assembly of workflows.
