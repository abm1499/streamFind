Description: The streamFind package consists of a backend and frontend
    platform for assembly of modular functionalities to support
    spectrometric and spectroscopic data processing for environmental and
    quality studies of the water cycle. The streamFind package is a data
    processing workflow designer to stimulate the use of advanced data
    analysis (e.g., non-target screening, statistical analysis, etc.) in
    routine studies, promoting standardization of data processing and
    easing the retrospective inclusion of data. With an open-source
    character, the streamFind package aims to enhance the use and faster
    adoption of functionalities from the scientific community.  The
    package can be used by academics but also by technicians due to the
    comprehensive documentation and well categorized set of
    functionalities (modules) integrated. The comprehensiveness of
    streamFind also eases and aims the implementation of new
    functionalities by skilled users, following the defined implementation
    rules.
