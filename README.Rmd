# streamFind

<!-- badges: end -->

The streamFind package is a backend (code based) and frontend ([shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app) platform for assembly of modular workflows to support spectrometric and spectroscopic data processing. The major focus of streamFind is data processing for environmental and quality studies. The streamFind package aims to stimulate the use of advanced data analysis (e.g., non-target screening, statistical analysis, etc.) in routine studies, promoting standardization of data processing and structure and easing the retrospective evaluation of data. The streamFind package can be used by academics but also by technicians due to the comprehensive documentation and well categorized set of integrated functionalities (modules). This handbook focuses on describing and demonstrating the backend of the streamFind package.

## Installation

For installation of the streamFind package, it is recommended to firstly ensure that the dependencies are currently installed. Several existing R packages and external functionalities are used in streamFind for various processing steps. A major dependency of streamFind is the [patRoon](https://github.com/rickhelmus/patRoon) R package.`r # TODO add reference` The patRoon package combines several functionalities for basic and advanced data processing and can be used interchangeably with streamFind, see \@ref(patroon-interchangeability) for more information. Most of the tools that patRoon depends on are equally used in streamFind. In the next sub-chapter, the mandatory and optional dependencies are described with installation instructions. For a standalone and self-contained usage option, the streamFind docker image is recommended (see \@ref(docker-image)), avoiding the need to installing all required dependencies.

### Install dependencies

#### R and RTools
 
[R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) are essential dependencies. The `r R.version.string` can be obtained in https://cran.r-project.org/. The RTools can be downloaded in https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/. Make sure to download the right version for the R version installed. Installation instructions are given in both sources.

#### Third party software

The external third party dependencies recommended are listed in the section [other dependencies](https://rickhelmus.github.io/patRoon/handbook_bd/manual-installation.html#other-dependencies) from the patRoon [handbook](https://rickhelmus.github.io/patRoon/handbook_bd/manual-installation.html#r-prerequisites). Below we list the mandatory and really recommended software and resources.

* [ProteoWizard](https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/), required for conversion of vendor MS formats to mzML/mzXML;  
* [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/), mandatory for patRoon when plotting structure using MetFrag;  
* [OpenMS](https://www.openms.de/downloads/); esternal tool for peak picking, grouping and alignment;  
* [MetFrag CL](http://ipb-halle.github.io/MetFrag/projects/metfragcl/), used for formula annotation in patRoon;  
* [PubChemLite](https://zenodo.org/record/6503754#.YtqxE3bP1hE), database used with MetFrag in patRoon;  
* [SIRIUS](https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/), tool for peak picking and formula annotation in patRoon;    
* [BioTransformer](https://bitbucket.org/djoumbou/biotransformer/downloads/), used for prediction of transformation products in patRoon;  
* [SAFD](https://bitbucket.org/SSamanipour/safd.jl/src/master/), tool for peak picking with data in profile mode;  
* [Open Babel](http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page), used in patRoon for validation of chemicals properties (e.g., InChI and formulae);  

#### R packages

The following code lines are adapted from the patRoon [handbook](https://rickhelmus.github.io/patRoon/handbook_bd/manual-installation.html#r-prerequisites) to ensure that both patRoon and other mutual R dependencies are installed properly.

```{r r-packages, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("BiocManager", "remotes"))

BiocManager::install(c("mzR", "xcms","CAMERA"))

remotes::install_github("blosloos/enviPick")

BiocManager::install("ropls")
remotes::install_github("rickhelmus/KPIC2") 

BiocManager::install("InterpretMSSpectrum")
remotes::install_github("cbroeckl/RAMClustR")

remotes::install_github("blosloos/nontargetData")
remotes::install_github("blosloos/nontarget")

remotes::install_github("rickhelmus/cliqueMS")

# only needed for Bruker DataAnalysis integration
remotes::install_github("BSchamberger/RDCOMClient")

BiocManager::install(c("BiocStyle", "Rgraphviz")) 
remotes::install_github("KelseyChetnik/MetaClean")

remotes::install_github("rickhelmus/patRoon", upgrade = "never", dependencies = TRUE)
```

After installation of the patRoon R package, the location of each third party software should be given in an `.Rprofile` file as suggested in section [other dependencies](https://rickhelmus.github.io/patRoon/handbook_bd/manual-installation.html#other-dependencies) the patRoon [handbook](https://rickhelmus.github.io/patRoon/handbook_bd/manual-installation.html#r-prerequisites). For facilitation the same code lines are given below. The function `patRoon::verifyDependencies()` from patRoon can be used to verify if all dependencies are found.

```{r options-third-party-software, eval=FALSE}
options(patRoon.path.pwiz = "C:/ProteoWizard") # location of ProteoWizard installation folder
options(patRoon.path.SIRIUS = "C:/sirius-win64-3.5.1") # location where SIRIUS was extracted
options(patRoon.path.OpenMS = "/usr/local/bin") # directory with the OpenMS binaries
options(patRoon.path.pngquant = "~/pngquant") # directory containing pngquant binary
options(patRoon.path.MetFragCL = "~/MetFragCommandLine-2.4.8.jar") # full location to the jar file
options(patRoon.path.MetFragCompTox = "C:/CompTox_17March2019_SelectMetaData.csv") # full location to desired CompTox CSV file
options(patRoon.path.MetFragPubChemLite = "~/PubChemLite_exposomics_20220429.csv") # full location to desired PubChemLite CSV file
options(patRoon.path.BioTransformer = "~/biotransformer/biotransformer-3.0.1.jar")
options(patRoon.path.obabel = "C:/Program Files/OpenBabel-3.0.0") # directory with Open Babel binaries
```
